# Project documentation

## Branches

In this project we make use of two branches: `master` and `development`. This is so that we can push code to `development` without making any changes to the current GitLab Pages-website, aka `master`. If we are forced to push code for various reasons we can do it easily without risk of intervening with the current live webpage.

## Run email tests/validation

Email tests are used for checking if an email exists and is correctly written. (We currently need to start them manually before we push)

    How to start email tests with Selenium in Python:

        - Install Python 3.8.5 (during installation check the box "Add Python to path", then reboot your system)

        - If you want to test emails from contacs.csv (execute emailvalidaion.py in your code environment)

        - If you get the message "(yourEmail) is correct" the test has passed. Otherwise it'll give you an error showing you what's wrong.

## Running the program

Before you can properly run the program you first need to make some minor changes.

### Gmail API


    Follow step one in the python quickstart guide (https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python)
    
        - Then you have created your own credentials.json file. Add it to your local repository.
    
    Follow step two to install the library by writing pip command in your terminal:
    
        - Modules needed for python to successfully run the script (pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib)
        
     Follow step three to create token file:
     
        - It will automatically add the file to the same path as credentials.json.
       

        
### Twitter API

        - Request access for twitter developer account

        - Once you have access navigate to the developer portal page
        
        - Create a project and request for API keys and token.
